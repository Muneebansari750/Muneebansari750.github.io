             <p id="ac">The creation of this portfolio provided me with a chance to reflect on both my technical skills and my teaching philosophy for the first time in several years.  As you browse around, I hope that you are able to gain a strong sense for who I am as a teacher and how I incorporate my philosophy in the classroom.  Each section of this portfolio represents a small piece of information that reflects who I am and what I am capable of.<br><br>
             My whole life I have strived to better myself through learning new things, meeting new people, and putting myself in a position to have opportunity. Whether this means pursuing individual study on various subjects such as religion and literature, teaching myself to play guitar, or enrolling in classes at the University, my goal is to become better for it in the end. </p>
